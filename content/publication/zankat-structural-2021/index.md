abstract: Semiconducting oxide nanocomposites of ZnO/SnO2 with different weight ratio,
  i.e. (i) ZnO:SnO2 = 100:0 (ZnO0), (ii) ZnO:SnO2 = 75:25 (ZnO25), and (iii) ZnO:SnO2
  = 50:50 (ZnO50), were prepared by sol–gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement
  reveals a rutile type tetragonal structure of SnO2 whereas hexagonal wurtzite structure
  of ZnO. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement suggests an effective
  role of SnO2 addition on the particle size of studied nanocomposites. Energy dispersive
  X-ray analysis (EDAX), carried out for elemental analysis for the studied nanocomposites,
  reveals the Sn deﬁciency in ZnO50 nanocomposite sample. Frequency dependent dielectric
  behavior recorded at different temperatures has been understood in the context of
  cole–cole plots for all the nanocomposites where variations in relaxation time and
  relaxation time distribution have been discussed in detail. Variation in ac conductivity
  has been discussed on the basis of Jonscher’s universal power law and crossover
  from correlated barrier hopping (CBH) mechanism to Maxwell–Wagner (M–W) relaxation
  has been identiﬁed for the studies nanocomposites. Overall electrical properties
  have been discussed in the context of oxygen vacancies, defects, disorder, and thermal
  energy in details.
