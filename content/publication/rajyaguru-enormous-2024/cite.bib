 abstract = {Field effect configuration (FEC) coupled field effect studies (FES) is one of the prime requisites for the development of spintronic based logic and memory devices having better sensitivities for external perturbations specifically while scaling down the technology. In this communication, LaMnO3–δ / La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / LaAlO3 (LMO / LCMO / LAO) manganite – manganite composite structure was successfully fabricated using cost effective chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. FEC coupled FES have been performed across the electrically polarizable LMO layer and LCMO conducting channel. Enormous room temperature colossal electroresistance (CER) has been acquired ~ 7000 % under 2 MV/cm forward biased control electric field and ~ 8.5 × 105 % under 0.9 MV/cm reverse biased control electric field. Elegant modifications in the resistive behavior have been understood on the bases of charge carrier density alterations, interface modifications, phase separation, Mott–type phase transformation and formation–break down of depletion region across the manganite –manganite composite structure.},
