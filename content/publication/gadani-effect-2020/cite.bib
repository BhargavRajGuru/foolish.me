 abstract = {In this communication, we report the dielectric response of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) grown Y0⋅95Sr0⋅05MnO3 (YSMO) manganite thin films (having two different thickness i.e. ~200 & 300 nm) on single crystalline Nb: SrTiO3 (SNTO) substrates. These films were irradiated by 200 MeV Agþ15 ions with different ion fluence. Structural studies, using X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, reveal single phase nature without any detectable impurity within the measurement range studied. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images reveal that grain size and grain boundaries are highly influenced by the SHI ion fluences and film’s thickness. Variations in dielectric constant with frequency, ion fluence, and film thickness have been discussed in the context of structural strain at the film–substrate interface, defect density and structural disorder in films. To understand the dielectric response of all the films with the help of universal dielectric response (UDR) model while cole-cole plots have been studied for the relaxation mechanisms.},
