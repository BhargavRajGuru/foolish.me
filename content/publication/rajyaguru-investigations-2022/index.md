abstract: In the present study, high quality LaMnO3–δ/La0⋅7Ca0⋅3MnO3/LaAlO3 (LMO/LCMO/LAO)
  manganite – manganite structure was successfully prepared using low cost chemical
  solution deposition (CSD) method. Temperature dependent resistive switching (RS)
  was performed across the manganite – manganite structure and various electronic
  processes have been employed to understand observed RS behavior. Various theoretical
  models have been used to understand the charge conduction involved in the hysteretic
  current – voltage (I–V) characteristics at different temperatures. Charge carrier
  conduction processes have been investigated for separate I–V cycles of RS characteristics
  where thermionic emission and space charge limited conduction mechanisms have been
  identified as appropriate charge carrier conduction mechanisms. Temperature dependent
  barrier height and other obtained fitting parameters have been discussed in detail.
