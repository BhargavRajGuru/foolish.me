abstract: In this communication, we report the results of the investigations on the
  structural and electrical properties of ZnO:Zn0.95Al0.05O (ZnO:ZAO) nanoparticles
  matrix composites, prepared with ZnO nanoparticles as ﬁllers and ZAO as a matrix
  using solegel and solid state reaction method, respectively. In order to study the
  structural properties, qe2q Xeray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed at
  room temperature using CuKa radiation. The crystallite size was calculated using
  Scherer's formula. Frequency dependent dielectric, ac conductivity and impedance
  have been carried out using high precision LCR meter in the frequency range of 20
  Hz to 2 MHz. Dielectric constant was also recorded for higher frequency range up
  to 3 GHz for all the samples and comparison based discussion has been represented
  for the possible relaxation processes at lower and higher frequency ranges. Relaxation
  mechanism and universal dielectric relaxation (UDR) model have been ﬁtted to dielectric
  behavior of the samples understudy throughout the frequency range (both, lower and
  higher). Frequency dependent variation in ac conductivity has been discussed on
  the basis of correlated barrier hopping (CBH) mechanism for presently studied samples.
  Role of ZnO ﬁllers content in the composites has also been discussed for the observed
  variations in impedance with frequency. Also, temperature (25e200 C) dependent dielectric,
  conductivity and impedance were studied for all the samples understudy. Variations
  in estimated activation energy (Ea) with ZnO ﬁllers content and frequency have been
  discussed in detail.
