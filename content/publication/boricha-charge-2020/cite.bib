 abstract = {In this communication, structure and charge, conduction mechanisms have been understood for sol–gelgrown nanostructured La0.6Nd0.1Sr0.3MnO3 (LNSMO) manganites prepared at different process temperatures under air and oxygen environments. Obtained X-ray diffraction patterns of all the samples were analysed using Rietveld reﬁnements and obtained structural lattice parameters have been discussed in correlation with resistivity behaviour of the samples. Observed low temperature resistivity upturn behaviour has been examined in the context of electron–electron scattering mechanism. Metallic and insulating/semiconducting behaviours of all the nanostructured LNSMO manganites have been understood by using various models and mechanisms. Magnetoresistance isotherms have also been theoretically ﬁtted and separate grain and grain boundary contributions have been studied for LNSMO manganite samples. All obtained ﬁtting parameters have been discussed in the context of role of applied magnetic ﬁeld, process temperature and annealing environment.},
