abstract: In this communication, structure and charge, conduction mechanisms have
  been understood for sol–gelgrown nanostructured La0.6Nd0.1Sr0.3MnO3 (LNSMO) manganites
  prepared at different process temperatures under air and oxygen environments. Obtained
  X-ray diffraction patterns of all the samples were analysed using Rietveld reﬁnements
  and obtained structural lattice parameters have been discussed in correlation with
  resistivity behaviour of the samples. Observed low temperature resistivity upturn
  behaviour has been examined in the context of electron–electron scattering mechanism.
  Metallic and insulating/semiconducting behaviours of all the nanostructured LNSMO
  manganites have been understood by using various models and mechanisms. Magnetoresistance
  isotherms have also been theoretically ﬁtted and separate grain and grain boundary
  contributions have been studied for LNSMO manganite samples. All obtained ﬁtting
  parameters have been discussed in the context of role of applied magnetic ﬁeld,
  process temperature and annealing environment.
