abstract: Control over the different electronic states in mixed valent manganites
  advances the development of oxide based electronic devices. In this context, carrier
  density is one of the key aspects that controls the electronic ground states of
  manganites in a sparkling way since it does not create any impurity within the manganite
  lattice, unlike chemical doping process. LaMnO3–δ / La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / LaAlO3 (LMO
  / LCMO / LAO) manganite based heterostructure was fabricated by low cost chemical
  solution deposition (CSD) method where thickness of LMO ~ 50 nm and LCMO ~ 100 nm
  were grown on (100) single crystalline substrate. Structural quality and epitaxial
  nature of heterostructure was verified by performing X–ray diffraction (XRD) ϕ–scan
  measurement on grown La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / LaAlO3 (LCMO / LAO) 100 nm thin film and LMO
  / LCMO / LAO heterostructure. Understanding of few other structural, morphological
  and chemical aspects of presently studied LMO / LCMO interface and LMO / LCMO /
  LAO heterostructure has been presented through grazing incidence X–ray diffraction
  (GIXRD), Rocking curve XRD, cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
  atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.
  Electric field modulated charge conduction for LCMO manganite channel has been understood
  in the context of field effect configuration (FEC) based transport measurements
  where temperature dependent LCMO channel resistance was recorded under different
  control electric fields applied across LMO / LCMO interface in LMO / LCMO / LAO
  heterostructure. Thermal hysteretic resistance measurements for LCMO manganite channel
  under zero control electric field exhibit metal to insulator phase transition at
  TP with finite width of the hysteretic resistance behaviours between two thermal
  cycles, i.e. cooling and heating. This has been understood on the basis of phase
  separation scenario, freezing effect and non–reversible electronic phase transformation.
  Applied control electric field induced improvement in resistance of LCMO manganite
  channel and reduction in value of TP have been understood on the basis of charge
  injection process, strain induced disorder dependent charge conduction, phase separation
  based movements of metal–insulator interface and negligibly small Joule heating
  effect. Realization of insulating phase fraction, arrested during thermal cycles,
  has been discussed for the explanation of reduced width of the hysteretic resistance
  behaviours of LCMO channel upon increase in control electric field applied across
  LMO / LCMO interface. Possible charge conduction mechanisms have been understood
  on the basis of Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law for obtained metallic
  state of LCMO channel. Variation in electroresistance (ER) of LCMO manganite channel
  with temperature under different control electric fields (applied across LMO / LCMO
  interface) has been discussed on the basis of charge injection process with an effective
  role of phase separation scenario of LCMO channel in LMO / LCMO / LAO heterostructure.
