abstract: In this communication, low resistive bulk La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO) was prepared
  by solid state reaction (SSR) route whereas high resistive nanoparticles of LaMnO3
  (LMO) was prepared by cost effective solegel technique. Composites of LMO and LCMO
  were prepared by mixing them in different weight ratios, i.e. LMO ¼ 10%, 20% and
  30% in LCMO manganite matrix. In the present study, LMO have been used as nanoparticle
  ﬁllers in the LCMO matrix lattice to study the transport properties of the composites.
  Xeray diffraction (XRD) measurement reveals the single phasic nature of the composites
  without any detectable impurity within the measurement range studied. XRD pattern
  of higher LMO content based composite possesses slightly different structural phases
  of LMO and LCMO. Resistivity measurement reveals that all the composites exhibit
  metal to insulator electronic phase transition at respective TP, wherein values
  of resistivity and TP get modiﬁed due to the cooling or heating cycles performed,
  measurement current used and LMO nanoparticle ﬁller content in the composites. These
  variations have been discussed in the context of scattering centres created due
  to the presence of LMO ﬁllers and complex phase separation scenario of the composites.
  A clear phase separation in higher ﬁller content based composite has been displayed
  in its resistivity behaviour. To understand the charge transport mechanisms responsible
  for metallic and insulating (or semiconducting) regions in resistivity behaviours
  of the composites, most suitable zener double exchange polynomial law and Mott type
  variable range hopping mechanism were ﬁtted theoretically to the obtained experimental
  results. Fittings show that spin ﬂuctuations in the composites are highly dependent
  on the cycles performed, current applied and LMO nanoparticle ﬁller content in the
  composites. Applied negative and positive current and voltage dependent resistance
  of the composites reveal the negative electroresistance. Both, resistance of the
  composites as well as electroresistance are highly affected by the cycles performed,
  current applied and LMO nanoparticle ﬁller content in the composites understudy.
  Temperature dependent electroresistance was studied for better insight into an active
  role of phase separation near electronic phase transition temperatures for all manganite
  based composites.
