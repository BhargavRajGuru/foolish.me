 abstract = {In the present communication, ZnO/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/Al2O3 (ZnO/LSMO/Al2O3) heterostructure was grown using chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique. X–ray diﬀraction (XRD) measurement conﬁrms the (100) crystallographic oriented growth of LSMO manganite and polycrystalline hexagonal growth of ZnO layer. Temperature dependent resistivity behavior under diﬀerent applied magnetic ﬁelds, performed for two diﬀerent geometries [current in plane (CIP) and current perpendicular to plane (CPP)], suggests the modiﬁcations in metal to insulator transition temperature TP and alterations in resistivity with applied magnetic ﬁeld and measurement geometry. This also implies the better charge conduction across the ZnO/LSMO interface (CPP) as compared to LSMO ﬁlm layer (CIP). Various charge conduction mechanisms have been employed to understand the charge transport for observed low temperature resistivity minimum, metallic behavior, insulating state and magnetoresistance (MR) of LSMO ﬁlm and ZnO/LSMO interface. Electroresistance (ER) and ﬁeld eﬀect conﬁguration (FEC) have been investigated across the ZnO/LSMO interface by recording the LSMO channel resistance, at room temperature, that suggest the tuning of signature and value of ER by considering forward and reverse bias modes across the interface. FEC studies show the large ER ∼ +750% and −85% across the LSMO channel with its tunability under diﬀerent interface biases.},
