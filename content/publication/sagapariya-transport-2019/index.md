abstract: In the present communication, ZnO/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/Al2O3 (ZnO/LSMO/Al2O3)
  heterostructure was grown using chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique. X–ray
  diﬀraction (XRD) measurement conﬁrms the (100) crystallographic oriented growth
  of LSMO manganite and polycrystalline hexagonal growth of ZnO layer. Temperature
  dependent resistivity behavior under diﬀerent applied magnetic ﬁelds, performed
  for two diﬀerent geometries [current in plane (CIP) and current perpendicular to
  plane (CPP)], suggests the modiﬁcations in metal to insulator transition temperature
  TP and alterations in resistivity with applied magnetic ﬁeld and measurement geometry.
  This also implies the better charge conduction across the ZnO/LSMO interface (CPP)
  as compared to LSMO ﬁlm layer (CIP). Various charge conduction mechanisms have been
  employed to understand the charge transport for observed low temperature resistivity
  minimum, metallic behavior, insulating state and magnetoresistance (MR) of LSMO
  ﬁlm and ZnO/LSMO interface. Electroresistance (ER) and ﬁeld eﬀect conﬁguration (FEC)
  have been investigated across the ZnO/LSMO interface by recording the LSMO channel
  resistance, at room temperature, that suggest the tuning of signature and value
  of ER by considering forward and reverse bias modes across the interface. FEC studies
  show the large ER ∼ +750% and −85% across the LSMO channel with its tunability under
  diﬀerent interface biases.
