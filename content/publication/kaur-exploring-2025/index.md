abstract: 'The pure (pristine) anatase TiO2 and N–doped TiO2 nanoparticles with varying
  nitrogen (N) concentrations of 0.3, 0.7 and 3 mol% were prepared via sol‒gel (auto‒combustion)
  method using titanium isopropoxide and urea as precursors of titanium and nitrogen
  respectively. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of all prepared
  samples were investigated using X‒ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform
  infrared (FTIR), dielectric, and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopic techniques.
  XRD analyses by performing Rietveld refinement confirm that all samples possess
  anatase phase having tetragonal structure (space group: I41/amd). The crystallite
  size of the nanoparticles is in range from ~8 to ~11 nm as evaluated from the most
  intense XRD (101) peak. The Raman modes corresponding to anatase phase are present
  in all analyzed samples and are in good agreement with XRD analyses. These results
  signify the synergetic substitutional and interstitial doping of nitrogen across
  the TiO2 lattice without affecting the anatase crystalline phase. FTIR spectra signify
  the presence of residual carboxylic group only in pristine TiO2, whilst, hydroxyl
  group is present in all the samples. The dielectric analyses revealed that the highest
  value of ac conductivity and dielectric constant was found at 3 mol% of N‒doping
  among the all prepared samples. The direct optical band gap reduced from 4.0 eV
  for pristine TiO2 to 2.3 eV for 0.7 mol% N–doped sample, after the incorporation
  of N ions across the TiO2 lattice. These results suggest that even small amount
  of N–doping may cause significant changes in the optical and electrical properties
  of TiO2 remaining the anatase phase unchanged.'
