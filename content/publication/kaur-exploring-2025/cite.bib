 abstract = {The pure (pristine) anatase TiO2 and N–doped TiO2 nanoparticles with varying nitrogen (N) concentrations of 0.3, 0.7 and 3 mol% were prepared via sol‒gel (auto‒combustion) method using titanium isopropoxide and urea as precursors of titanium and nitrogen respectively. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of all prepared samples were investigated using X‒ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), dielectric, and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopic techniques. XRD analyses by performing Rietveld refinement confirm that all samples possess anatase phase having tetragonal structure (space group: I41/amd). The crystallite size of the nanoparticles is in range from ~8 to ~11 nm as evaluated from the most intense XRD (101) peak. The Raman modes corresponding to anatase phase are present in all analyzed samples and are in good agreement with XRD analyses. These results signify the synergetic substitutional and interstitial doping of nitrogen across the TiO2 lattice without affecting the anatase crystalline phase. FTIR spectra signify the presence of residual carboxylic group only in pristine TiO2, whilst, hydroxyl group is present in all the samples. The dielectric analyses revealed that the highest value of ac conductivity and dielectric constant was found at 3 mol% of N‒doping among the all prepared samples. The direct optical band gap reduced from 4.0 eV for pristine TiO2 to 2.3 eV for 0.7 mol% N–doped sample, after the incorporation of N ions across the TiO2 lattice. These results suggest that even small amount of N–doping may cause significant changes in the optical and electrical properties of TiO2 remaining the anatase phase unchanged.},
