abstract: We report current–voltage (I–V) device characteristics of pulsed laser deposition
  (PLD) grown La0.5Gd0.2Ca0.3MnO3 (LGCMO) manganite thin films on single crystalline
  (100) Nb:SrTiO3 (SNTO) substrates. LGCMO films were irradiated using 100 MeV O+9
  swift heavy ions (SHI). The θ–2θ X–ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy
  (AFM) measurement were performed at room temperature, respectively, for understanding
  the structural and microstructural behaviors of the films. The current–voltage (I–V)
  data were taken under the bias voltage applied across LGCMO/SNTO p–n interfaces
  at room temperature. Observed I–V behaviors for all interfaces have been discussed
  in the context of lattice strain, grain size and grain boundary density. To study
  the effect of annihilation on the irradiated LGCMO films, 50 nm thick ZnO layer
  was grown on the surface of LGCMO/SNTO films using chemical solution deposition
  (CSD) method under oxygen environment with a controlled flow. XRD, AFM and I–V measurements
  were performed again for annealed ZnO/LGCMO interfaces. Observed I–V characteristics
  across ZnO/LGCMO interface have been discussed in details in the context of annihilation
  induced modifications in the interface, structural strain and surface morphology.
