Control over the movements of free charge carriers across any manganite based interface can functionalize the device for spintronic applications. This can be achieved through external stimuli that alter various electronic phases of manganites having comparable energy levels. In the present communication, the LaMnO

(LMO/LCMO/LAO) manganite–manganite structure was successfully fabricated using a cost effective chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. Field effect configuration was employed to understand the interface resistive nature of the LMO/LCMO interface for which externally applied interface electric fields have been applied across the same interface. The applied interface electric field considerably affects the LMO/LCMO interface resistivity which has been discussed in the context of free charge carrier movements across the same interface. The state of the spin fluctuations across manganite lattices has been recognized by fitting the resistivity behavior theoretically using the Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law. Complex electroresistance (ER) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behaviors have been discussed in detail for understanding the electrical nature of the LMO/LCMO interface under different applied stimuli.},
