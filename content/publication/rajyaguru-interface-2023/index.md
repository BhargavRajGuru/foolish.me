abstract: Control over the movements of free charge carriers across any manganite
  based interface can functionalize the device for spintronic applications. ,   Control
  over the movements of free charge carriers across any manganite based interface
  can functionalize the device for spintronic applications. This can be achieved through
  external stimuli that alter various electronic phases of manganites having comparable
  energy levels. In the present communication, the LaMnO 3 /La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3 /LaAlO
  3 (LMO/LCMO/LAO) manganite–manganite structure was successfully fabricated using
  a cost effective chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. Field effect configuration
  was employed to understand the interface resistive nature of the LMO/LCMO interface
  for which externally applied interface electric fields have been applied across
  the same interface. The applied interface electric field considerably affects the
  LMO/LCMO interface resistivity which has been discussed in the context of free charge
  carrier movements across the same interface. The state of the spin fluctuations
  across manganite lattices has been recognized by fitting the resistivity behavior
  theoretically using the Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law. Complex electroresistance
  (ER) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behaviors have been discussed in detail
  for understanding the electrical nature of the LMO/LCMO interface under different
  applied stimuli.
