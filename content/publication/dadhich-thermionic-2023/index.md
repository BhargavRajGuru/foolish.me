abstract: In the present communication, temperature dependence of resistive switching
  (RS) behavior across chemically grown LaMnO3/La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LMO/LCMO) interface
  have been discussed by employing various theoretical approaches and mechanisms.
  Temperature dependent RS behavior of LMO/LCMO interface highlights impactful switching
  between high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS) under reverse
  bias mode through an active role of depletion region. Trapping–detrapping processes
  assisted charge conduction has been identified as a source of RS nature of LMO/LCMO
  interface. Thermionic emission model and space charge limited conduction (SCLC)
  mechanism have been employed to understand the charge conduction and charge transport
  across LMO/ LCMO interface. Present structure of Ag/LMO/LCMO/Ag has also been investigated
  for possible retention and endurance behaviors under different external parameters
  which verify the stability, reliability, reproducibility, non–volatile nature and
  applicability of LMO/LCMO interface.
