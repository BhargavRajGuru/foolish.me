abstract: In this report, ZnO /La0.3Ca0.7MnO3 /SrTiO3 (ZnO /LCMO /STO) heterostructures,
  with various thicknesses of LCMO, were grown successfully using chemical solution
  deposition (CSD) method. X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurement confirms the presence
  of LCMO and ZnO phases only without any other unwanted phases. To understand the
  charge conduction mechanisms across ZnO /LCMO interface as well as for LCMO manganite
  thin layer, temperature dependent resistivity measurements have been investigated
  under different applied magnetic fields. The measured ρ (T) data of all the heterostructures
  in current perpendicular to plane (CPP; for ZnO /LCMO interface studies) mode and
  current in plane (CIP; for LCMO thin layer studies) mode show the semiconducting
  behaviour throughout the temperature and magnetic field range studied. The semiconducting
  state of all the heterostructures have been studied using Mott type variable range
  hopping (VRH) mechanism to understand the field dependence of charge carrier localization
  length. Observed negative magnetoresistance (MR) has been discussed in detail with
  its dependence on applied magnetic field, temperature and manganite layer thickness.
