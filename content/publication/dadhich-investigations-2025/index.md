abstract: Identification and understanding of charge conduction mechanisms for functional
  oxide based devices become necessary to implement any potential applications in
  spintronics. In this context, present communication deals with the phenomenological
  percolation model that governs the charge transport properties of chemically grown
  LaFeO3/La0.7Ca0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LFO/LCMO/STO) structure. Various structural aspects
  have been explored through X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Temperature dependent
  resistivity behaviors [recorded under current in plane (CIP) mode and current perpendicular
  to plane (CPP) modes] under different applied magnetic fields have been understood
  using phenomenological percolation model. In this, phase separation scenario and
  disordered interface between LFO and LCMO layers have been identified to play effectively
  their interesting roles. Intrinsic and extrinsic contributions of MR have been identified
  for both the measurement geometries across LCMO thin film and LFO/LCMO interface.
  Isothermal magnetoresistance (MR) behaviors have been explained on the basis of
  universal model for MR isotherms which strongly support the role of electronic phase
  fluctuations and disordered LFO/LCMO interface. Present research findings demonstrate
  a practical approach to tune the resistive state of functional oxides by precisely
  controlling the interface between them. This also serves a better way to control
  the resistive state of functional oxide thin films by applying external magnetic
  field and to understand related charge conduction processes.
