abstract: Swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiated LaMnO3/La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LMO/LCMO) interfaces
  have been investigated to understand their charge transport and conduction mechanisms.
  Prominent effect of ion fluence has been discussed for the interface resistivity
  behaviors and metal to insulator phase transition for LMO/LCMO interfaces on the
  bases of lattice strain, crystalline granular state, crystalline imperfection, average
  grain size, grain boundary density and rms surface roughness. Field effect configuration
  (FEC) has been employed to study the interesting modifications in the irradiated
  LMO/LCMO interface resistivity under different applied electric fields to understand
  the depletion region, free charge carrier density, ferromagnetic phase fractions
  and crystal field based distortions. A Phenomenological percolation model has been
  employed to understand the role of phase separation in governing the charge conduction
  processes across LMO/LCMO interfaces.
