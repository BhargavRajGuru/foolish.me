 abstract = {Interface in thin film is the most sensitive tool to alter the transport, magnetic and other physical properties of functional materials. In the present communication, LaMnO3/Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LMO/NSMO/STO) manganite structures were prepared by sol–gel–assisted chemical solution deposition (CSD) followed by irradiation using 100 MeV O7+ high energetic ions. Irradiation induced modifications in the structural and microstructural aspects of LMO/NSMO/STO structures have been explored to understand the LMO/NSMO interface resistivity recorded under the influence of 5 μA applied interface current. Modifications in the LMO/NSMO interface resistivity through different thermal cycles, namely, zero field cooled cooling (ZFC), field cooled cooling (FCC) and field cooled warming (FCW) (ZFC–FCC–FCW protocol) have been understood based on the trapping or freezing and release of trapped electronic phase fractions. While metallic nature of the interface has been explored based on Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law for charge conduction, the semiconducting nature of interface resistivity on small polaron conduction mechanism where variation in activation energy (Ea) with thermal cycle and ion fluence. Ion fluence and interface current influenced MR has been explored across the LMO/NSMO interface.},
