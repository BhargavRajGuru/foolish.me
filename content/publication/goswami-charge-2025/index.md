abstract: Interface in thin film is the most sensitive tool to alter the transport,
  magnetic and other physical properties of functional materials. In the present communication,
  LaMnO3/Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LMO/NSMO/STO) manganite structures were prepared by
  sol–gel–assisted chemical solution deposition (CSD) followed by irradiation using
  100 MeV O7+ high energetic ions. Irradiation induced modifications in the structural
  and microstructural aspects of LMO/NSMO/STO structures have been explored to understand
  the LMO/NSMO interface resistivity recorded under the influence of 5 μA applied
  interface current. Modifications in the LMO/NSMO interface resistivity through different
  thermal cycles, namely, zero field cooled cooling (ZFC), field cooled cooling (FCC)
  and field cooled warming (FCW) (ZFC–FCC–FCW protocol) have been understood based
  on the trapping or freezing and release of trapped electronic phase fractions. While
  metallic nature of the interface has been explored based on Zener double exchange
  (ZDE) polynomial law for charge conduction, the semiconducting nature of interface
  resistivity on small polaron conduction mechanism where variation in activation
  energy (Ea) with thermal cycle and ion fluence. Ion fluence and interface current
  influenced MR has been explored across the LMO/NSMO interface.
