abstract: ZnO/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (ZnO/LSMO) based p–n junction heterostructure was synthesized
  using sol–gel assisted chemical solution deposition technique. The structural and
  microstructural characterizations were carried out by X–ray diffraction and atomic
  force microscopy for the study of film growth and surface morphology. The transport
  properties of the heterostructure were studied using two different measurement protocols,
  namely, current–in–plane (CIP) and current–perpendicular to–plane (CPP). The resistivity
  curves were best fitted with Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial. I–V characteristics
  were measured for CIP and CPP modes at different temperatures, which suggest rectifying
  behaviour of the studied heterostructure. The difference between forward bias current
  and reverse bias current and also current through CIP and CPP modes have been extensively
  studied. The resistance was measured under the influence of applied electric field
  and temperature, which shows a positive electroresistive (ER) effect. The electric
  field and temperature dependent ER suggests the presence of colossal electroresistance
  (CER) in the studied heterostructure, with its values exceeding 400 % for CPP mode
  and 150 % for CIP mode of measurement. Field effect tuning of properties and positive
  CER of the heterostructure emerge to become applicative in the genre of field sensor
  and memory storage applications.
