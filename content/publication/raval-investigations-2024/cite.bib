 abstract = {In this communication, the effect of doping of divalent cations (Sr, Ca) at Y–site in pure YMnO3 on their structural and electrical properties has been investigated. X–ray diffraction reveals dual phase nature of Ca–doped sample. The dielectric behaviours have been fitted using cole–cole relaxation. Role of secondary phase of 41% hexagonal YMnO3 coexists with 59% orthorhombic Y0.9Ca0.1MnO3 for Ca–doped YMnO3 compound has been discussed where orthorhombic phase provides major contribution for large dielectric constant. The ac conductivity has been explained by correlated barrier hopping mechanism. The current–voltage characteristics have been understood using Simmon’s model.},
