abstract: 'In this communication, we have successfully fabricated mixed valent La0.7Ca0.3MnO3
  (LCMO) manganite based (i) ZnO/LCMO/LAO and (ii) LMO/LCMO/LAO (LMO: LaMnO3–d thin
  layer; LAO: LaAlO3 substrate) thin ﬁlm heterostructures using chemical solution
  deposition (CSD) method. 100 nm LCMO layer was initially grown on single crystalline
  (100) LAO substrate followed by the growth of 50 nm ZnO and LMO layers separately
  on the two diﬀerent heterostructures. In the present study, upper layers of ZnO
  and LMO were intentionally prepared at 700 °C for 12 h under air environment, thereby
  some naturally created oxygen vacancies are expected to be present in their lattices.
  Presence of oxygen vacancies makes ZnO and LMO layers as n–type oxides in the heterostructures.
  Temperature dependent current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and interface resistivity
  (under diﬀerent applied electric ﬁelds across interface only) were carried out to
  understand their charge transport behavior. A strong eﬀect of electric ﬁeld on the
  resistivity behavior has been observed due to a reasonable electrically polarizable
  (active) nature of ZnO and LMO thin layers. Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial
  law has been employed to understand various scattering processes as source of resistivity
  across, both, ZnO/ LCMO and LMO/LCMO interfaces. Transport properties and charge
  conduction mechanisms have been discussed and compared for both the interfaces in
  the context of interface state and barrier between electrically active layer and
  LCMO ﬁlm. Also, power consumption criteria have been discussed in detail for the
  presently studied heterostructures for their practical device applications such
  as ﬁeld eﬀect devices, memory devices, read–write head devices or any other spintronic
  devices.'
