 abstract = {In the present communication, temperature dependence of resistive switching (RS) behavior across chemically grown LaMnO3/La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LMO/LCMO) interface have been discussed by employing various theoretical approaches and mechanisms. Temperature dependent RS behavior of LMO/LCMO interface highlights impactful switching between high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS) under reverse bias mode through an active role of depletion region. Trapping–detrapping processes assisted charge conduction has been identified as a source of RS nature of LMO/LCMO interface. Thermionic emission model and space charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism have been employed to understand the charge conduction and charge transport across LMO/ LCMO interface. Present structure of Ag/LMO/LCMO/Ag has also been investigated for possible retention and endurance behaviors under different external parameters which verify the stability, reliability, reproducibility, non–volatile nature and applicability of LMO/LCMO interface.},
