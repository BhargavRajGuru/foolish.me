 abstract = {Multiferroic nanoparticles of BiFe0.95Co0.05O3 (BFCO) with diﬀerent sizes were prepared by low temperature acetate precursor based modiﬁed sol–gel method. X–ray diﬀraction (XRD) measurement revealed rhombohedral phase of nanoparticles. Crystallite size increases from ∼41.05 nm (700 °C) to ∼ 48.42 nm (800 °C). The dielectric constant and loss tangent were studied as a function of temperature at diﬀerent frequencies. The appearance of dielectric anomalies around antiferromagnetic transition temperature prove the existence of possible magnetoelectric (ME) coupling. Possible present ME coupling has been studied by performing magnetodielectric (MD) measurements at room temperature. The strong variation in dielectric constant and loss has been found under the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld at room temperature. The magnetoimpedance (MI) measurement was studied to separate out intrinsic and extrinsic MD eﬀect. Spin spiral suppression at nanoscale with crystallite size less than ∼62 nm and lattice strain, arises due to Cobalt doping, play an important role in controlling multiferroic properties.},
