abstract: Multiferroic nanoparticles of BiFe0.95Co0.05O3 (BFCO) with diﬀerent sizes
  were prepared by low temperature acetate precursor based modiﬁed sol–gel method.
  X–ray diﬀraction (XRD) measurement revealed rhombohedral phase of nanoparticles.
  Crystallite size increases from ∼41.05 nm (700 °C) to ∼ 48.42 nm (800 °C). The dielectric
  constant and loss tangent were studied as a function of temperature at diﬀerent
  frequencies. The appearance of dielectric anomalies around antiferromagnetic transition
  temperature prove the existence of possible magnetoelectric (ME) coupling. Possible
  present ME coupling has been studied by performing magnetodielectric (MD) measurements
  at room temperature. The strong variation in dielectric constant and loss has been
  found under the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld at room temperature. The magnetoimpedance
  (MI) measurement was studied to separate out intrinsic and extrinsic MD eﬀect. Spin
  spiral suppression at nanoscale with crystallite size less than ∼62 nm and lattice
  strain, arises due to Cobalt doping, play an important role in controlling multiferroic
  properties.
