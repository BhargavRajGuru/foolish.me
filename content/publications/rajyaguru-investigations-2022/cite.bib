 abstract = {In the present study, high quality LaMnO3–δ/La0⋅7Ca0⋅3MnO3/LaAlO3 (LMO/LCMO/LAO) manganite – manganite structure was successfully prepared using low cost chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. Temperature dependent resistive switching (RS) was performed across the manganite – manganite structure and various electronic processes have been employed to understand observed RS behavior. Various theoretical models have been used to understand the charge conduction involved in the hysteretic current – voltage (I–V) characteristics at different temperatures. Charge carrier conduction processes have been investigated for separate I–V cycles of RS characteristics where thermionic emission and space charge limited conduction mechanisms have been identified as appropriate charge carrier conduction mechanisms. Temperature dependent barrier height and other obtained fitting parameters have been discussed in detail.},
