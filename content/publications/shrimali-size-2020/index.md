abstract: Nanostructured polycrystalline samples of BiFe0.98Co0.02O3 (BFCO) with various
  sizes were prepared using acetate precursor based modiﬁed solegel method. Rhombohedral
  phase of nanoparticles has been conﬁrmed by Xeray diffraction (XRD) measurement.
  The electrical and magnetic properties of samples were investigated for different
  sized nanoparticles (47.25e93.30 nm). The effect of sintering temperature on the
  structural, microstructural and dielectric properties has been discussed in the
  context of crystallite size and oxygen vacancy concentration. The temperature dependent
  impedance study conﬁrms that the temperature dependent relaxation process is non
  Debye type and dominated by the shorterange movement of oxygen vacancies. The value
  of magnetization is found to increase with decreasing particle size. Large magnetodielectric
  (MD) effect has been observed for BFCO nanoparticles with size less than ~ 62 nm.
  Complex impedance spectroscopy analysis has been used to ensure intrinsic MD effect.
