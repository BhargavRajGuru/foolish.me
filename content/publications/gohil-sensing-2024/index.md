abstract: In the present communication, the electrical transport properties have been
  investigated for manganite-based composites consisting of different weight fractions
  of nanoparticles of LaMnO3 (LMO) and polycrystalline La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO). A complex
  phase separation scenario has been proposed to understand the hysteretic resistive
  nature exhibited by manganite matrix composites. The role of complex phase separation
  has been discussed for the manganite composite resistivity and temperature coefficient
  of resistance (TCR) dependence on temperature, thermal cycle, current and LMO content
  as well as their sensitivity for voltage and current have also been examined. Observed
  electric pulse-induced resistance (EPIR) switching in these composites under different
  applied voltages and magnetic fields have been understood based on a complex phase
  separation scenario and the formation–rupture of conducting filamentary paths. Tuning
  of magnetic field-dependent resistance and magnetoresistance (MR) with the influence
  of different resistance states of LMO–LCMO composites has been understood in depth.
