 abstract = {In the present communication, the electrical transport properties have been investigated for manganite-based composites consisting of different weight fractions of nanoparticles of LaMnO3 (LMO) and polycrystalline La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO). A complex phase separation scenario has been proposed to understand the hysteretic resistive nature exhibited by manganite matrix composites. The role of complex phase separation has been discussed for the manganite composite resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) dependence on temperature, thermal cycle, current and LMO content as well as their sensitivity for voltage and current have also been examined. Observed electric pulse-induced resistance (EPIR) switching in these composites under different applied voltages and magnetic fields have been understood based on a complex phase separation scenario and the formation–rupture of conducting filamentary paths. Tuning of magnetic field-dependent resistance and magnetoresistance (MR) with the influence of different resistance states of LMO–LCMO composites has been understood in depth.},
