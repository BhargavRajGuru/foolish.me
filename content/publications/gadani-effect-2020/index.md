abstract: 'In this communication, we report the dielectric response of pulsed laser
  deposition (PLD) grown Y0⋅95Sr0⋅05MnO3 (YSMO) manganite thin films (having two different
  thickness i.e. ~200 & 300 nm) on single crystalline Nb: SrTiO3 (SNTO) substrates.
  These films were irradiated by 200 MeV Agþ15 ions with different ion fluence. Structural
  studies, using X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, reveal single phase nature without
  any detectable impurity within the measurement range studied. Atomic force microscopy
  (AFM) images reveal that grain size and grain boundaries are highly influenced by
  the SHI ion fluences and film’s thickness. Variations in dielectric constant with
  frequency, ion fluence, and film thickness have been discussed in the context of
  structural strain at the film–substrate interface, defect density and structural
  disorder in films. To understand the dielectric response of all the films with the
  help of universal dielectric response (UDR) model while cole-cole plots have been
  studied for the relaxation mechanisms.'
