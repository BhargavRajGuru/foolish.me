abstract: 'Defect induced structural, microstructural, resistive switching (RS) characteristics
  and related responsible charge conduction mechanisms of Y0⋅95Ca0⋅05MnO3 (YCMO) manganite
  films, grown on single crystalline (100) Nb: SrTiO3 (SNTO) substrates (0.2 wt% Nb
  doped at Ti–site in SrTiO3), are reported in this communication. Films were irradiated
  by 100 MeV O+7swift heavy ions (SHI) with different ion fluence. Structural studies
  were performed using X–ray diffraction (XRD) and XRD φ–scan measurements for all
  pristine and irradiated films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement was performed
  to understand the granular morphology and surface modifications in YCMO films due
  to SHI irradiation. Observed RS behavior has been ascribed to the trapping–detrapping
  processes, modifications in the depletion region, movement of oxygen vacancies and
  tunneling process across the interface barriers between YCMO and SNTO. Various models
  and mechanisms have been employed to understand the observed charge transport across
  the interfaces. All the films show endurance and retention behaviors that suggest
  the reproducibility, dynamic stability and reliability of presently studied films
  as non–volatile memory devices.'
