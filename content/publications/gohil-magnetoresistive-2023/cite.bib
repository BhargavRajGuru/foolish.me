 abstract = {In this communication, LaMnO3/La0⋅7Ca0⋅3MnO3/LaAlO3 (LMO/LCMO/LAO) structure was prepared by low cost sol–gel based chemical solution deposition (CSD) method. Field effect configuration (FEC) based LMO/LCMO interface resistive nature has been investigated for the LMO/LCMO/LAO structure. Temperature dependent interface resistivity modulation factor has been understood using forward and reverse bias modes. Temperature dependent LMO/LCMO interface resistivity has been discussed in detail under different applied magnetic fields, different applied interface electric fields and different magnetic field directions to identify simultaneous possible existence of magnetoresistance (MR), electroresistance (ER) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effects across the same LMO/LCMO interface. Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law has been fitted theoretically to the obtained interface resistive nature to understand the possible spin fluctuations across the LMO/LCMO interface.},
