abstract: In this communication, LaMnO3/La0⋅7Ca0⋅3MnO3/LaAlO3 (LMO/LCMO/LAO) structure
  was prepared by low cost sol–gel based chemical solution deposition (CSD) method.
  Field effect configuration (FEC) based LMO/LCMO interface resistive nature has been
  investigated for the LMO/LCMO/LAO structure. Temperature dependent interface resistivity
  modulation factor has been understood using forward and reverse bias modes. Temperature
  dependent LMO/LCMO interface resistivity has been discussed in detail under different
  applied magnetic fields, different applied interface electric fields and different
  magnetic field directions to identify simultaneous possible existence of magnetoresistance
  (MR), electroresistance (ER) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effects across
  the same LMO/LCMO interface. Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law has been
  fitted theoretically to the obtained interface resistive nature to understand the
  possible spin fluctuations across the LMO/LCMO interface.
