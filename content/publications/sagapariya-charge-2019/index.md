abstract: In this communication, we report the results of the structural and transport
  studies performed on ZnO/ La0.7Ca0.3MnO3/LaAlO3 (ZnO//LAO) heterostructure grown
  using simple, low cost, vacuum free and environment friendly chemical solution deposition
  (CSD) method. ZnO is found to be polycrystalline while LCMO film orientations suggest
  its single crystalline growth, parallel with the crystallographic orientations of
  LAO substrate. Double peak transition behavior, observed in the R – T, has been
  discussed on the basis of phase coexistence scenario. Charge transport behavior
  and charge conduction mechanisms have been investigated by performing current–voltage
  (I–V) characteristics at different temperatures. Various electronic and thermal
  processes have been proposed as sources of backward diode like characteristics observed
  across ZnO/LCMO interface. Complex variations in electroresistance (ER) have been
  discussed on the basis of charge injection, depletion region modifications, tunneling,
  breakdown and thermal processes.
