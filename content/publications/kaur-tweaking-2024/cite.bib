 abstract = {The pure nanostructured anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) and subsequent nitrogen–doped derivatives (TiO2–xNx; where, x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.05) were synthesized by sol–gel auto–combustion technique. XRD analysis confirms the formation of pure anatase phase of TiO2 up to doping of 1 mol% (x = 0.01) of nitrogen having tetragonal structure with space group of I41/amd whereas an additional monoclinic phase of TiO2–B was observed at 5 mol % of nitrogen doping in TiO2. This sample has smallest crystallite size of ~4.7 ± 0.2 nm corresponding to TiO2–B phase and ~12.0 ± 0.1 nm corresponding to anatase phase. XRD also reveals that the crystallite size of all other samples having pure anatase phase ranges between ~8.7 ± 0.1 nm & 13.9 ± 0.1 nm. The crystalline phase revealed from XRD of all samples was further supported by the Raman analysis. The direct optical band gap of pure TiO2 (~3.4 eV) was reduced non–monotonically after nitrogen doping in the ranges from ~2.8 eV (TiO1.95N0.05) to ~2.0 eV (TiO1.99N0.01). FTIR spectra confirm the metal oxide bond formation, surface adsorption of water molecules and presence of residual hydroxyl group in all crystalline samples. HRTEM analysis validates the coexistence of secondary phase of TiO2–B along with anatase phase of TiO2 in studied highest doped sample (TiO1.95N0.05) including its broader particle size distribution as compared to pure TiO2. The electrical studies reveal that the highest values of dielectric constant and ac conductivity can be realized for pure TiO2 and at 1 mol% (x = 0.01) of nitrogen doping, among all the studied nitrogen doped samples.},
