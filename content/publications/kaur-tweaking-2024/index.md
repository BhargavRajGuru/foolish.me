abstract: The pure nanostructured anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) and subsequent nitrogen–doped
  derivatives (TiO2–xNx; where, x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.05) were synthesized by sol–gel
  auto–combustion technique. XRD analysis confirms the formation of pure anatase phase
  of TiO2 up to doping of 1 mol% (x = 0.01) of nitrogen having tetragonal structure
  with space group of I41/amd whereas an additional monoclinic phase of TiO2–B was
  observed at 5 mol % of nitrogen doping in TiO2. This sample has smallest crystallite
  size of ~4.7 ± 0.2 nm corresponding to TiO2–B phase and ~12.0 ± 0.1 nm corresponding
  to anatase phase. XRD also reveals that the crystallite size of all other samples
  having pure anatase phase ranges between ~8.7 ± 0.1 nm & 13.9 ± 0.1 nm. The crystalline
  phase revealed from XRD of all samples was further supported by the Raman analysis.
  The direct optical band gap of pure TiO2 (~3.4 eV) was reduced non–monotonically
  after nitrogen doping in the ranges from ~2.8 eV (TiO1.95N0.05) to ~2.0 eV (TiO1.99N0.01).
  FTIR spectra confirm the metal oxide bond formation, surface adsorption of water
  molecules and presence of residual hydroxyl group in all crystalline samples. HRTEM
  analysis validates the coexistence of secondary phase of TiO2–B along with anatase
  phase of TiO2 in studied highest doped sample (TiO1.95N0.05) including its broader
  particle size distribution as compared to pure TiO2. The electrical studies reveal
  that the highest values of dielectric constant and ac conductivity can be realized
  for pure TiO2 and at 1 mol% (x = 0.01) of nitrogen doping, among all the studied
  nitrogen doped samples.
