 abstract = {Structural properties and charge conduction mechanisms in La0.6Pr0.1Ca0.3MnO3 (LPCMO) manganite has been studied. Presently studied LPCMO manganite was successfully synthesized by solid state reaction method. Structural studies using X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurement at room temperature conﬁrm single phase orthorhombic unit cell without any impurity. A methodical investigation of electrical resistivity was undertaken, for both, as a function of temperature as well as magnetic ﬁeld. It is observed that LPCMO sample shows metal to insulator transition at TP as well as low resistivity upturn around 30K. Various models and mechanisms have been studied to verify the charge transport properties for low temperature upturn, metallic behavior as well as insulating/semiconducting behavior. Magnetoresistance (MR) behaviors at different temperatures have been theoretically understood on the basis of contributions from grain and grain boundaries.},
