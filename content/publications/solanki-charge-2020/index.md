abstract: Structural properties and charge conduction mechanisms in La0.6Pr0.1Ca0.3MnO3
  (LPCMO) manganite has been studied. Presently studied LPCMO manganite was successfully
  synthesized by solid state reaction method. Structural studies using X–ray diffraction
  (XRD) measurement at room temperature conﬁrm single phase orthorhombic unit cell
  without any impurity. A methodical investigation of electrical resistivity was undertaken,
  for both, as a function of temperature as well as magnetic ﬁeld. It is observed
  that LPCMO sample shows metal to insulator transition at TP as well as low resistivity
  upturn around 30K. Various models and mechanisms have been studied to verify the
  charge transport properties for low temperature upturn, metallic behavior as well
  as insulating/semiconducting behavior. Magnetoresistance (MR) behaviors at different
  temperatures have been theoretically understood on the basis of contributions from
  grain and grain boundaries.
