abstract: We report electrical transport properties across the interface of composites
  consisting of n -type LaMnO 3−δ and p -type La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3 manganites grown
  on LaAlO 3 single crystalline substrates using low cost wet CSD and well-controlled
  dry CVD techniques.  ,   In this communication, we report results of the electrical
  transport properties across the interface of composites consisting of n -type LaMnO
  3−δ (LMO) and p -type La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3 (LCMO) manganites grown on LaAlO 3 (LAO)
  single crystalline substrates using low cost wet chemical solution deposition (CSD)
  and sophisticated, well-controlled dry chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chemical
  techniques. The XRD ϕ -scan studies reveal the single crystalline nature of both
  bilayered composites, with parallel epitaxial growth of LMO and LCMO layers onto
  the LAO substrate. The valence states of Mn ions in both layers of both composites
  were identified by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The I – V
  characteristics of the LMO/LCMO interfaces show strong backward diode-like behavior
  at higher applied voltages well above the crossover voltage ( V NB ). Below V NB
  , the interfaces demonstrate normal diode-like characteristics throughout the studied
  temperature range. The electric field-induced modulation of the LMO/LCMO junction
  resistance of the interfaces has been observed. Electric field-dependent electroresistance
  (ER) modifications at different temperatures have also been studied. The electrical
  transport properties have been discussed in the context of various mechanisms, such
  as charge injection, tunneling, depletion region modification and thermal processes
  across the interface. The effects of structurally and chemically developed sharp
  interfaces between the LMO and LCMO layers on the transport properties of the presently
  studied bilayered thin film composites have been discussed on the basis of correlation
  between the physicochemical characterization and charge transport behavior. A comparison
  of different aspects of the transport properties has been presented in the context
  of the structural strain and crystallinity of the composites grown using both wet
  and dry chemical techniques.
