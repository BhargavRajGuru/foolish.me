 abstract = {In the present communication, high crystalline quality LaMnO3/Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LMO/NSMO/STO) structures were fabricated using low cost chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique to perform swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation using 100 MeV O+7 ions. X–ray diffraction (XRD) θ–2θ, XRD φ–scan and XRD ω–scan results show a single phase nature having finite and ion fluence influenced strain state, four–fold lattice symmetry with epitaxial growth and an effective influence of ion fluence on the crystalline granular structure of LMO/NSMO/ STO structure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images suggest an effect of ion fluence on the surface morphology through the creation of defects and local annealing effect. Zero field cooled (ZFC) protocol based LMO/NSMO interface resistivity suggests that transport nature of the LMO/NSMO interface of all studied LMO/NSMO/STO structures is strongly governed by lattice strain between LMO//NSMO layers and STO substrate, strain across LMO and NSMO manganite layers, crystalline granular structure, grain size, grain boundary density and grain boundary nature of the LMO and NSMO manganite thin layers. ZFC protocol followed by field cooled cooling (FCC) and field cooled warming (FCW) protocols for the realization of LMO/NSMO interface resistivity behaviors have been understood on the bases of freezing and trapping of tiny high temperature high resistive insulating clusters within the coexisting low temperature low resistive metallic phase fraction. Observed LMO/NSMO interface resistivity behaviors have been understood using the percolation model fits to the recorded experimental LMO/NSMO interface resistivity data in addition to irradiation influences. Obtained fitting parameters have been discussed in detail based on their variations with different employed resistivity measurement protocols for all pristine and irradiated LMO/NSMO/STO structures.},
