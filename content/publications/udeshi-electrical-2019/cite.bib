 abstract = {In this communication, we report the results of the electrical studies on La1–xPrxMnO3 (LPMO; 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) single valent manganites synthesized by conventional solid state reaction route. Structural studies reveal a single phasic nature of all LPMO samples having orthorhombic unit cell structure without any detectable impurity or structural phase transformation. Dielectric constant and impedance are found to increase while ac conductivity gets suppressed eﬀectively upon increase in Pr content (x). This has been discussed in detail on the basis of structural distortion and tolerance factor in LPMO manganites. Temperature dependent dielectric behavior indicates an anomaly near respective magnetic transition temperature. Obtained dielectric and ac conductivity results have been theoretically ﬁtted using relaxation formula and power law, respectively. Obtained ﬁtting parameters have been discussed in the context of various structural aspects of LPMO manganites.},
