abstract: In this communication, we report the results of the electrical studies on
  La1–xPrxMnO3 (LPMO; 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) single valent manganites synthesized by conventional
  solid state reaction route. Structural studies reveal a single phasic nature of
  all LPMO samples having orthorhombic unit cell structure without any detectable
  impurity or structural phase transformation. Dielectric constant and impedance are
  found to increase while ac conductivity gets suppressed eﬀectively upon increase
  in Pr content (x). This has been discussed in detail on the basis of structural
  distortion and tolerance factor in LPMO manganites. Temperature dependent dielectric
  behavior indicates an anomaly near respective magnetic transition temperature. Obtained
  dielectric and ac conductivity results have been theoretically ﬁtted using relaxation
  formula and power law, respectively. Obtained ﬁtting parameters have been discussed
  in the context of various structural aspects of LPMO manganites.
