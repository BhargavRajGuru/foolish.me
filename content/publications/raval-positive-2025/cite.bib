 abstract = {ZnO/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (ZnO/LSMO) based p–n junction heterostructure was synthesized using sol–gel assisted chemical solution deposition technique. The structural and microstructural characterizations were carried out by X–ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy for the study of film growth and surface morphology. The transport properties of the heterostructure were studied using two different measurement protocols, namely, current–in–plane (CIP) and current–perpendicular to–plane (CPP). The resistivity curves were best fitted with Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial. I–V characteristics were measured for CIP and CPP modes at different temperatures, which suggest rectifying behaviour of the studied heterostructure. The difference between forward bias current and reverse bias current and also current through CIP and CPP modes have been extensively studied. The resistance was measured under the influence of applied electric field and temperature, which shows a positive electroresistive (ER) effect. The electric field and temperature dependent ER suggests the presence of colossal electroresistance (CER) in the studied heterostructure, with its values exceeding 400 % for CPP mode and 150 % for CIP mode of measurement. Field effect tuning of properties and positive CER of the heterostructure emerge to become applicative in the genre of field sensor and memory storage applications.},
