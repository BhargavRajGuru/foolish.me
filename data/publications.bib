In order to study the structural properties, qe2q Xeray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed at room temperature using CuKa radiation. The crystallite size was calculated using Scherer's formula. Frequency dependent dielectric, ac conductivity and impedance have been carried out using high precision LCR meter in the frequency range of 20 Hz to 2 MHz. Dielectric constant was also recorded for higher frequency range up to 3 GHz for all the samples and comparison based discussion has been represented for the possible relaxation processes at lower and higher frequency ranges. Relaxation mechanism and universal dielectric relaxation (UDR) model have been ﬁtted to dielectric behavior of the samples understudy throughout the frequency range (both, lower and higher). Frequency dependent variation in ac conductivity has been discussed on the basis of correlated barrier hopping (CBH) mechanism for presently studied samples. Role of ZnO ﬁllers content in the composites has also been discussed for the observed variations in impedance with frequency. Also, temperature (25e200 C) dependent dielectric, conductivity and impedance were studied for all the samples understudy. Variations in estimated activation energy (Ea) with ZnO ﬁllers content and frequency have been discussed in detail.},

The doping effects at corresponding non–metal and transition metal sites of TiO2 on the basis of the structural, optical and electrical properties have been investigated. X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurement conﬁrms the formation of pure anatase phase of TiO2 for all samples having I41/amd space group of tetragonal structure which has been also veriﬁed by the Raman spectroscopy measurement. Various crystallographic parameters have been calculated by performing Rietveld reﬁnement of XRD data including average crystallite size that has been observed in the range of 10–15 nm. Pure anatase phase indicates the incorporation of Co2+ into TiO2 lattice which assists the substitution of N in place of oxygen in co–doped TiO2. The band gap tuning towards the visible region from 3.2 to 2.1 eV has been achieved with mono–doping and co–doping of the N and Co in TiO2 lattice. This can be described in terms of the formation of localized levels of N–2p and Co–3d states in mono–doping and an isolated intermediate band formation in co–doping case. Electrical properties have been investigated in details and explained as the synergetic effects of structural and inherent ionic characters of various dopants. The observed band gaps of all doped samples lie within the visible region which makes them pertinent as the solar energy harnessing materials for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications. © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Chinese Society for Metals.},

Field effect configuration was employed to understand the interface resistive nature of the LMO/LCMO interface for which externally applied interface electric fields have been applied across the same interface. The applied interface electric field considerably affects the LMO/LCMO interface resistivity which has been discussed in the context of free charge carrier movements across the same interface. The state of the spin fluctuations across manganite lattices has been recognized by fitting the resistivity behavior theoretically using the Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law. Complex electroresistance (ER) and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behaviors have been discussed in detail for understanding the electrical nature of the LMO/LCMO interface under different applied stimuli.},

The thickness of both the YCMO and YSMO thin film devices were {\textasciitilde}300 nm. The hysteretic current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured at 100 and 300 K across the YAMO/SNTO interfaces using current perpendicular to plane (CPP) transport measurement geometry. Both these devices exhibit distinct RS behaviours and these are highly influenced by the temperature, ionic size of dopants (i.e. Ca and Sr) and structural disorder as well as lattice mismatch between the films and substrates. While the YCMO/SNTO device exhibits an effective RS behavior in the reverse bias mode, the YSMO/SNTO device in the forward bias mode. The current compliance effects were observed for both the thin film devices and in both the bias modes and their modifications with different parameters. These results are discussed in the light of oxygen vacancies, their distribution and mobility. Thermionic emission model has been employed to understand the charge conduction mechanism across the YAMO/SNTO junctions. The variations in the barrier height has been obtained by fitting the experimental data of I–V with different temperatures, resistance states, dopants and bias modes and discussed in detail.

	abstract = {In the present communication, high crystalline quality LaMnO3/Nd0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LMO/NSMO/STO) structures were fabricated using low cost chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique to perform swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation using 100 MeV O+7 ions. X–ray diffraction (XRD) θ–2θ, XRD φ–scan and XRD ω–scan results show a single phase nature having finite and ion fluence influenced strain state, four–fold lattice symmetry with epitaxial growth and an effective influence of ion fluence on the crystalline granular structure of LMO/NSMO/ STO structure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images suggest an effect of ion fluence on the surface morphology through the creation of defects and local annealing effect. Zero field cooled (ZFC) protocol based LMO/NSMO interface resistivity suggests that transport nature of the LMO/NSMO interface of all studied LMO/NSMO/STO structures is strongly governed by lattice strain between LMO//NSMO layers and STO substrate, strain across LMO and NSMO manganite layers, crystalline granular structure, grain size, grain boundary density and grain boundary nature of the LMO and NSMO manganite thin layers. ZFC protocol followed by field cooled cooling (FCC) and field cooled warming (FCW) protocols for the realization of LMO/NSMO interface resistivity behaviors have been understood on the bases of freezing and trapping of tiny high temperature high resistive insulating clusters within the coexisting low temperature low resistive metallic phase fraction. Observed LMO/NSMO interface resistivity behaviors have been understood using the percolation model fits to the recorded experimental LMO/NSMO interface resistivity data in addition to irradiation influences. Obtained fitting parameters have been discussed in detail based on their variations with different employed resistivity measurement protocols for all pristine and irradiated LMO/NSMO/STO structures.},

	abstract = {Control over the different electronic states in mixed valent manganites advances the development of oxide based electronic devices. In this context, carrier density is one of the key aspects that controls the electronic ground states of manganites in a sparkling way since it does not create any impurity within the manganite lattice, unlike chemical doping process. LaMnO3–δ / La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / LaAlO3 (LMO / LCMO / LAO) manganite based heterostructure was fabricated by low cost chemical solution deposition (CSD) method where thickness of LMO {\textasciitilde} 50 nm and LCMO {\textasciitilde} 100 nm were grown on (100) single crystalline substrate. Structural quality and epitaxial nature of heterostructure was verified by performing X–ray diffraction (XRD) ϕ–scan measurement on grown La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 / LaAlO3 (LCMO / LAO) 100 nm thin film and LMO / LCMO / LAO heterostructure. Understanding of few other structural, morphological and chemical aspects of presently studied LMO / LCMO interface and LMO / LCMO / LAO heterostructure has been presented through grazing incidence X–ray diffraction (GIXRD), Rocking curve XRD, cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Electric field modulated charge conduction for LCMO manganite channel has been understood in the context of field effect configuration (FEC) based transport measurements where temperature dependent LCMO channel resistance was recorded under different control electric fields applied across LMO / LCMO interface in LMO / LCMO / LAO heterostructure. Thermal hysteretic resistance measurements for LCMO manganite channel under zero control electric field exhibit metal to insulator phase transition at TP with finite width of the hysteretic resistance behaviours between two thermal cycles, i.e. cooling and heating. This has been understood on the basis of phase separation scenario, freezing effect and non–reversible electronic phase transformation. Applied control electric field induced improvement in resistance of LCMO manganite channel and reduction in value of TP have been understood on the basis of charge injection process, strain induced disorder dependent charge conduction, phase separation based movements of metal–insulator interface and negligibly small Joule heating effect. Realization of insulating phase fraction, arrested during thermal cycles, has been discussed for the explanation of reduced width of the hysteretic resistance behaviours of LCMO channel upon increase in control electric field applied across LMO / LCMO interface. Possible charge conduction mechanisms have been understood on the basis of Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial law for obtained metallic state of LCMO channel. Variation in electroresistance (ER) of LCMO manganite channel with temperature under different control electric fields (applied across LMO / LCMO interface) has been discussed on the basis of charge injection process with an effective role of phase separation scenario of LCMO channel in LMO / LCMO / LAO heterostructure.},

	abstract = {In this communication, low resistive bulk La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO) was prepared by solid state reaction (SSR) route whereas high resistive nanoparticles of LaMnO3 (LMO) was prepared by cost effective solegel technique. Composites of LMO and LCMO were prepared by mixing them in different weight ratios, i.e. LMO ¼ 10\%, 20\% and 30\% in LCMO manganite matrix. In the present study, LMO have been used as nanoparticle ﬁllers in the LCMO matrix lattice to study the transport properties of the composites. Xeray diffraction (XRD) measurement reveals the single phasic nature of the composites without any detectable impurity within the measurement range studied. XRD pattern of higher LMO content based composite possesses slightly different structural phases of LMO and LCMO. Resistivity measurement reveals that all the composites exhibit metal to insulator electronic phase transition at respective TP, wherein values of resistivity and TP get modiﬁed due to the cooling or heating cycles performed, measurement current used and LMO nanoparticle ﬁller content in the composites. These variations have been discussed in the context of scattering centres created due to the presence of LMO ﬁllers and complex phase separation scenario of the composites. A clear phase separation in higher ﬁller content based composite has been displayed in its resistivity behaviour. To understand the charge transport mechanisms responsible for metallic and insulating (or semiconducting) regions in resistivity behaviours of the composites, most suitable zener double exchange polynomial law and Mott type variable range hopping mechanism were ﬁtted theoretically to the obtained experimental results. Fittings show that spin ﬂuctuations in the composites are highly dependent on the cycles performed, current applied and LMO nanoparticle ﬁller content in the composites. Applied negative and positive current and voltage dependent resistance of the composites reveal the negative electroresistance. Both, resistance of the composites as well as electroresistance are highly affected by the cycles performed, current applied and LMO nanoparticle ﬁller content in the composites understudy. Temperature dependent electroresistance was studied for better insight into an active role of phase separation near electronic phase transition temperatures for all manganite based composites.},

The transport properties of the heterostructure were studied using two different measurement protocols, namely, current–in–plane (CIP) and current–perpendicular to–plane (CPP). The resistivity curves were best fitted with Zener double exchange (ZDE) polynomial. I–V characteristics were measured for CIP and CPP modes at different temperatures, which suggest rectifying behaviour of the studied heterostructure. The difference between forward bias current and reverse bias current and also current through CIP and CPP modes have been extensively studied. The resistance was measured under the influence of applied electric field and temperature, which shows a positive electroresistive (ER) effect. The electric field and temperature dependent ER suggests the presence of colossal electroresistance (CER) in the studied heterostructure, with its values exceeding 400 \% for CPP mode and 150 \% for CIP mode of measurement.

The structural, electrical, and optical properties of all prepared samples were investigated using X‒ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), dielectric, and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopic techniques. XRD analyses by performing Rietveld refinement confirm that all samples possess anatase phase having tetragonal structure (space group: I41/amd). The crystallite size of the nanoparticles is in range from {\textasciitilde}8 to {\textasciitilde}11 nm as evaluated from the most intense XRD (101) peak. The Raman modes corresponding to anatase phase are present in all analyzed samples and are in good agreement with XRD analyses. These results signify the synergetic substitutional and interstitial doping of nitrogen across the TiO2 lattice without affecting the anatase crystalline phase. FTIR spectra signify the presence of residual carboxylic group only in pristine TiO2, whilst, hydroxyl group is present in all the samples. The dielectric analyses revealed that the highest value of ac conductivity and dielectric constant was found at 3 mol\% of N‒doping among the all prepared samples. The direct optical band gap reduced from 4.0 eV for pristine TiO2 to 2.3 eV for 0.7 mol\% N–doped sample, after the incorporation of N ions across the TiO2 lattice. These results suggest that even small amount of N–doping may cause significant changes in the optical and electrical properties of TiO2 remaining the anatase phase unchanged.},

In this context, present communication deals with the phenomenological percolation model that governs the charge transport properties of chemically grown LaFeO3/La0.7Ca0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LFO/LCMO/STO) structure. Various structural aspects have been explored through X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Temperature dependent resistivity behaviors [recorded under current in plane (CIP) mode and current perpendicular to plane (CPP) modes] under different applied magnetic fields have been understood using phenomenological percolation model. In this, phase separation scenario and disordered interface between LFO and LCMO layers have been identified to play effectively their interesting roles. Intrinsic and extrinsic contributions of MR have been identified for both the measurement geometries across LCMO thin film and LFO/LCMO interface. Isothermal magnetoresistance (MR) behaviors have been explained on the basis of universal model for MR isotherms which strongly support the role of electronic phase fluctuations and disordered LFO/LCMO interface. Present research findings demonstrate a practical approach to tune the resistive state of functional oxides by precisely controlling the interface between them. This also serves a better way to control the resistive state of functional oxide thin films by applying external magnetic field and to understand related charge conduction processes.},

The direct optical band gap of pure TiO2 ({\textasciitilde}3.4 eV) was reduced non–monotonically after nitrogen doping in the ranges from {\textasciitilde}2.8 eV (TiO1.95N0.05) to {\textasciitilde}2.0 eV (TiO1.99N0.01). FTIR spectra confirm the metal oxide bond formation, surface adsorption of water molecules and presence of residual hydroxyl group in all crystalline samples. HRTEM analysis validates the coexistence of secondary phase of TiO2–B along with anatase phase of TiO2 in studied highest doped sample (TiO1.95N0.05) including its broader particle size distribution as compared to pure TiO2. The electrical studies reveal that the highest values of dielectric constant and ac conductivity can be realized for pure TiO2 and at 1 mol\% (x = 0.01) of nitrogen doping, among all the studied nitrogen doped samples.},
